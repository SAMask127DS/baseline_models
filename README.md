A Create a .csv file out of the given data and put it online (you will use a link to it in your
program).

B Create a time series plot to visualise the data.

C Decompose the time series into three components (trend, seasonal and residuals). Present
the decomposition together with the observed data in the same figure. What conclusions
can you make about the time series by looking at the graphs?

D Divide the data into a train set and a test set.

E Implement the four baseline models: historical mean, last yearâ€™s mean, last known value
and naive seasonal forecast.

F Compare these baselines models. Which of them looks more efficient for our time series?
